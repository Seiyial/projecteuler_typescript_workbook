# TypeScript [projecteuler.com](https://projecteuler.com) solver

## How to try yourself

0. If you're trying it yourself, delete everything in the `./solves` folder.
1. Open https://projecteuler.info and open the first problem or the problem you're facing today.
2. Run `yarn next URL` where `URL` is the URL of that problem page.
3. Open the file generated for you and enter the solution there.
4. Once solved, mark your solution as solved by changing `export const solved: boolean = false` to `true`, then run `yarn next` (which will import the next question).
